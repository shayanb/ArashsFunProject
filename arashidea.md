an MCMC simulation app that navigates different probability distributions visually and interactive.

MCMC: Markov chain Monte Carlo

visually show the distribution based on the simulated data, and a controller to select MCMC and model parameters like step size, number of iterations, burn-in period, etc, and see how they affect the sampling process and the resulting distribution, visually. 


Simulated data: input data can be generated from different distributions (normal, uniform, exponential, etc.) with different parameters or uploaded by the user.
